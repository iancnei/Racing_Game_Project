##OOP Racing Game
### WDI Weekend Project

### Technologies Used
The predominant feature used was the HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.  Jquery, HTML, and CSS were used to a basic degree to obtain information in a simple manner, which was then transfered over to the canvas.  Some starter code (Jquery Hotkeys, Key_status, clamp function) was taken from the No Tears Guide to HTML5 Games by Daniel X. Moore: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/ .

###Existing features
You can choose what color you want your racing square to be.  You can change what you call yourself.  You can see the finish line.  Game logic works fine irregardless of initial window size.  Default values for each player is implemented.  You can reset the game via the reset button at any time.

###Planned features
Add sprite animations.  Redo the player avatar to be sprite characters with intro, running/dashing/lunging, winning and losing animations.  Add in a Countdown and a Finish animation.  Add sound effects to go alongside the animations.  Add in a background.  Allow the browser window to be resized and resize the canvas accordingly.  Get a timer to record how long each race takes.
